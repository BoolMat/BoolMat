This directory contains everything required to compute a minimal generating set
for the monoid of n x n boolean matrices and the monoid of reflexive n x n
boolean matrices. An internet connection is required (since several resources
are downloaded), but it should be as simple as typing:

  make full-3 

which will compute a minimal generating set for the monoid of 3 x 3 boolean matrices.
Other valid inputs are:
- full-4, -5, -6, -7, and -8, although this last one will take a long time to run; and
- ref-3, -4, -5, -6, and -7, for generators of the reflexive boolean matrices.

The generators will be output in pickled GAP matrix format, readable using the
Semigroups package, as well as in integer format, where the values are packed
into 64 bits and output as an integer.

To utilise more threads in the computation:
- for the full monoid, in Makefile change the second value passed to
  sh/full-run.sh to the desired number of cores
- for the reflexive monoid, set the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS
