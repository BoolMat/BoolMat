This directory contains everything required to compute a minimal generating
set for the monoid of n x n boolean matrices. An internet connection is
required (since several resources are downloaded), but it should be as simple
as typing:

  make 4 

which will compute a minimal generating set for the 4 x 4 boolean matrices.
Other valid inputs are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, although this last one will take a
long time to run.
